# I'm the Pushbag!

## The Pushbag Rules

You put one NIS coin in the jar if you are guilty of either of the following:


* ### Hurtful Push
  * You commited code that results in some build error.
  * You committed code that fails a test.
  * Your changes prevented someone else from working.

* ### Ridiculous Commit
  * You wrote ridiculously invalid HTML or CSS.
  * You caused a page to trigger a Javascript error on page load.
  * You have a syntax error or you broke the coding guidelines.
  * You left an intrusive piece of debug code.
  * You pushed a commit with an empty or meaningless commit message.
  * You have committed changes that bluntly violate basic coding standards.
  
* ### No push

  You did not push any code to a remote branch all day.

* ### Bad deploy

  You deployed bad or buggy code to an external server.


* ### Bad merge

  You did not merge your changes properly, and committed conflicted code or overwritten somebody else's work.

* ### Bad Ethics

  You conducted yourself in a manner that violates the Pushbag spirit, system and its symbols. _(i.e., joking about the rules or desecrating the Pushbag jar.)_


## No excuses!

Once someone calls your shit, you have to:

1. Put a Shekel in the jar.
2. Move the jar and this sign to your desk.

**Don't be a douchebag!** Accept your peers' judgement without arguing.  
This system is based on trust!

This list will be updated from time to time to reflect the current rules system.
